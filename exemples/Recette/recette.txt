French Meringues

Ingredients
	4 egg whites
	2,25 cups confectioners' sugar 
Directions

Step 1
Preheat the oven to 200 degrees F (95 degrees C). Butter and flour a baking sheet.

Step 2
In a glass or metal bowl, whip egg whites until foamy using an electric mixer. Sprinkle in sugar a little at a time, while continuing to whip at medium speed.

Step 3
Place the meringues in the oven and place a wooden spoon handle in the door to keep it from closing all the way. Bake for 3 hours, or until the meringues are dry, and can easily be removed from the pan.
